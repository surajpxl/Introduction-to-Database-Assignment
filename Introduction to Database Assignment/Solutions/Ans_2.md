2. Write a short note on File-based storage system. Explain the major challenges of a File-based storage system.

Answer=> File-based storage system: In a file-based storage system, data is stored in individual files, typically on a disk or other storage medium. These files are organized by file names and directories, and data can be accessed sequentially or randomly, depending on how the file system is designed.

Challenges of a File-based storage system:

Redundancy: Data may be duplicated across different files, leading to inefficiency and increased storage requirements.
Data Integrity: Managing data consistency across files becomes difficult, especially when multiple users or applications access the data simultaneously.
Scalability: As the amount of data increases, the file system can become difficult to manage and may suffer performance issues.
Data Retrieval: Searching and retrieving data from files can be slow and inefficient compared to database management systems that are optimized for this purpose.
Concurrency: File systems don't support concurrent access to data very well, leading to conflicts and data corruption if multiple users attempt to access the same file simultaneously.
