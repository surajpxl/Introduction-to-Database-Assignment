6. What is the significance of Data Modeling and explain the types of data modeling.

Answer=> Significance of Data Modeling:

Data Integrity: Ensures the consistency and accuracy of data through well-defined relationships, constraints, and structures.
Improved Communication: Helps stakeholders (like developers, users, and business analysts) understand the system and the data it uses.
Efficient Database Design: Helps to design a database that is efficient, scalable, and easier to maintain.
Query Optimization: Enables efficient querying of the database by defining the right relationships and structures.
Types of Data Modeling:

Conceptual Data Model:

Focuses on high-level structures and the overall relationships between different entities.
Example: An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram showing entities like Customers, Orders, and Products, and the relationships between them.
Logical Data Model:

More detailed than the conceptual model, specifying the data types, keys, and relationships but still independent of a particular database management system (DBMS).
Example: A model where you define tables, columns, data types (integer, string), and constraints (primary keys, foreign keys).
Physical Data Model:

Specifies how the data will be physically stored in the database, including indexing strategies, file organization, and performance considerations.
Example: Indexing of certain columns for faster search, table partitioning, or specifying how data is distributed across disks.
