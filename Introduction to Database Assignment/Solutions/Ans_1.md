1. What is a Database? Explain with an example why should we need a database.

Answer=> Database: A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed in a way that allows easy retrieval, updating, and manipulation of data. It is usually organized in tables, which consist of rows and columns.

Example: Consider an online shopping platform where customers can browse products, add them to the cart, and make purchases. A database is used to store customer information (names, addresses, purchase history), product details (names, prices, stock levels), and transaction data (order IDs, payment status, etc.).

Why do we need a database?

Efficient Data Management: Databases allow businesses to store vast amounts of data in an organized way, making it easier to search, update, and manage data.
Data Integrity and Consistency: Databases enforce rules (constraints) to maintain data accuracy and consistency (e.g., no duplicate customer records).
Scalability: As the volume of data grows, databases can handle it efficiently, supporting the business's scalability.
Security: Databases provide controlled access to data to ensure security, allowing only authorized users to access or modify specific information.
