3. What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?

Answer=> DBMS (Database Management System): A DBMS is a software system that provides an interface for users to create, manage, and interact with databases. It handles the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data in a structured format, ensuring that data is consistent, secure, and easily accessible.

Need for DBMS:

Efficiency: DBMS systems provide powerful querying and indexing capabilities, making data retrieval more efficient compared to file-based systems.
Data Integrity: DBMS ensures that the data is accurate and consistent by enforcing constraints and rules.
Security: DBMS allows administrators to set user permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify certain data.
Concurrency Control: DBMS systems allow multiple users to access and modify data simultaneously without conflicts, using mechanisms like transactions and locks.
Backup and Recovery: DBMS systems include features for backing up data and recovering it in case of a failure.
